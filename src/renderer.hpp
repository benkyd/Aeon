// The renderer will need to render to some sort of buffer
// which the display, in this case, temporarily the pixel
// game engine, will display.

// The primary feature of the engine's rendere will be
// global illumination, which i will later offload to the
// GPU

// The engine will need to be able to render polygons as well
// as sprites eventually, for now though i will focus on 
// polygons, as they work with global illumination best.
